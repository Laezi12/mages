	#Having specific traits to be pro- and anti- 
	#each ideology violates the KISS principle.
	#Too bad!
	#
	#Basically, a communist sympathizer will always
	#defect to a communist government in a civil war,
	#while remaining with the original government in
	#all other circumstances.
	#
	#Meanwhile, an anti-communist will always defect
	#away from a communist government while remaining
	#with the original government in all other cases.
	#
	#This means that if a single trait were to be used,
	#like for example, making Tanya have the 'single
	#monarchist' trait, that Tanya would defect to the
	#rebellion even if the new government was democratic,
	#an ideology she would have no problem with.
	#
	#Because of this, the traits must be split.
	#
	#I hate it and wish it was simpler.
	#
	#To use these in a civil war, see scripted triggers.
	#nevermind that, it's all been handled by on_actions
